class BeamModel(ABC):
    r"""Model of an antenna primary beam.

    This is a model that describes the response of an antenna in a particular
    direction relative to nominal pointing direction, for each polarization
    and for a range of frequencies.

    It is most likely specific to an antenna, elevation, or other variables.
    However, it is specified in a frame oriented to the dish rather than the
    sky, so remains valid with parallactic angle rotation. Description of the
    mount type (e.g. Alt-Az versus equatorial or 3-axis) is currently beyond
    the scope of this class.

    The phase of the electric field at a point increases with time i.e., the
    phasor is

    .. math:: e^{(\omega t - kz)i}

    The "ideal" complex voltage is multiplied by the beam model to obtain the
    measured voltage.

    If you stick your right arm out and left hand up, then pretend to be an
    antenna (lean back and look at the sky) then they correspond to the
    directions of positive horizontal and vertical polarization respectively
    (the absolute signs don't matter but the signs relative to each other do
    for cross-hand terms).

    The grid is regularly sampled in azimuth and elevation, but may be
    irregularly sampled in frequency. The samples are ordered in increasing
    order of azimuth (north to east) and elevation (horizon to zenith). Note
    that this system has the opposite handedness to RA/Dec.
