           The visibilities are assumed to use a convention in which the phase

           [HB1996]_.

           The sign convention for UVW matches the definition for measurement
           sets, but is opposite to that actually used by CASA_ (and thus by
           other imagers that give consistent results with CASA).

        time/baseline coordinate. The second index is x/y/z for 'uvw' and
        polarization product for 'vis' and 'weights'.  Flags are not explicitly
        returned: they are either omitted entirely (if all pols are flagged) or
        indicated with a zero weight.

        If :meth:`has_feed_angles` returns ``False``, then `feed_angle1` and
        `feed_angle2` will be absent.
